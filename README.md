PFQ v4.1 
========

Introduction
------------

PFQ is a functional networking framework designed for the Linux operating system 
that allows efficient packets capture/transmission, in-kernel functional processing 
and packets steering across sockets/end-points.

PFQ is highly optimized for multi-core architecture, as well as for network devices 
equipped with multiple hardware queues. It works with any network device driver and 
provides a script designed to obtain accelerated versions starting from their source codes.

The framework enables the development of high-performance networking applications with 
different programming languages: C, C++11 and Haskell. In addition, a pure functional language 
designed for early stages applications is included: PFQ/lang.

PFQ/lang is inspired by Haskell and allows to create small applications that run in 
kernel space, on top of network device drivers. Through PFQ/lang it is possible to create 
efficient bridges, port mirrors, simple firewalls, network balancers and so forth.

The package provides the source code of the PFQ kernel module, user-space libraries for C, 
C++11-14 and Haskell language, an implementation of PFQ/lang as eDSL for C++11-14 and Haskell, 
and a set of diagnostic tools.
